"""SafetyChecker — Production-hardened safety filtering for SafeVixAI chatbot.

Fixes audit issue C2 / SECURITY#1:
- Expanded from 5 → 60+ blocked patterns
- Unicode NFKC normalization before matching (blocks fullwidth/homoglyph attacks)
- Zero-width character stripping (U+200B, U+200C, U+200D, U+FEFF, etc.)
- Jailbreak pattern detection (DAN, roleplay exploits, instruction overrides)
- Language-agnostic obfuscation detection (space insertion, l33t speak)
- Output safety check (detect if LLM response accidentally contains harmful content)
- Medical disclaimer injected on first-aid/medical topics
