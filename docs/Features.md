# SafeVixAI  Features Specification

## Module 1: Emergency Locator (SafeVixAI Core)

### F1.1  GPS Auto-Detection
- Uses `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` with `enableHighAccuracy: true`
- 10-second timeout, cached for 30 seconds (maximumAge)
- On deny: clear error screen with instructions to enable GPS in browser settings
- `watchPosition` auto-refreshes nearby list when user moves > 500m

### F1.2 — Nearby Emergency Services Map
- MapLibre GL with dark vector tiles (free, no API key)
- Color-coded circle markers: hospitals (red), police (blue), ambulance (red+cross), fire (orange-red), towing (amber), puncture (green)
- Each marker popup: name, distance, phone, **Tap-to-Call** button, **Directions** (Google Maps deep link)
- Services sorted: has_trauma first → is_24hr → distance ASC
- Each marker popup: name, distance, phone, **Tap-to-Call** button, **Directions** (Google Maps deep link)
- Services sorted: has_trauma first  is_24hr  distance ASC

### F1.3  Tiered Radius Fallback
- Sequence: 500m  1km  5km  10km  25km  50km
- If PostGIS < 3 results: expand radius automatically
- If DB still sparse at 50km: Overpass API live fallback
- UI badge shows actual search radius used: "Showing services within 25km"

### F1.6  Crash Detection
- DeviceMotion API at ~60Hz
- Thresholds: Minor 6G, Moderate 15G, Severe 30G (multi-tier)
