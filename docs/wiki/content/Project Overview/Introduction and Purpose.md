## Introduction
SafeVixAI is an AI-powered road safety platform designed to address three critical road safety challenges in India: emergency response, legal assistance, and road infrastructure reporting. Built for the IIT Madras Road Safety Hackathon 2026, the platform integrates a tactical, life-safety-focused UI with robust backend services, an agentic RAG chatbot, and a fully capable frontend PWA. Its mission is to reduce road accident mortality by dramatically improving response times, legal literacy, and transparency around road maintenance.

Key pillars:
- Zero infrastructure cost: 100% free and open source, leveraging free-tier cloud services and browser-based AI.
- Tactical UX: A dark, high-contrast, terminal-inspired interface optimized for emergency and operational tasks.
- Offline-first: Five independent offline layers ensure core features remain functional without connectivity.
- Open-source and community-driven: Transparent development, modular architecture, and contribution guidelines to foster collaboration.

Impact:
- Emergency response: Instant, accurate, and resilient emergency locator with SOS sharing and crash detection.
- Legal assistance: Deterministic challan calculator and a multilingual legal assistant grounded in the Motor Vehicles Act and WHO guidelines.
- Road infrastructure reporting: Intuitive, geotagged reporting with automatic authority routing and transparency into maintenance records.

Scalability:
- Modular microservices architecture supports independent scaling of backend, chatbot, and frontend.
- Free-tier deployment model demonstrates replicability across regions and contexts.
- Community-driven governance and documentation accelerate adoption and contributions.

## Project Structure
SafeVixAI is organized as a three-service monorepo:
- Backend (FastAPI + PostGIS + Redis): Emergency locator, challan calculator, road reporting, routing, and geocoding.
- Chatbot Service (FastAPI + ChromaDB + 9 LLM providers): Agentic RAG chatbot with intent detection, safety checks, and multilingual routing.
- Frontend (Next.js 15 PWA): Map-centric UI with offline AI, crash detection, and emergency workflows.

## Detailed Component Analysis

### Emergency Locator: Real-Time Response and Resilience
The Emergency Locator module powers instant, accurate emergency service discovery with offline resilience and crash detection.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant U as "User"
participant FE as "Frontend"
participant API as "Backend : 8000"
participant R as "Redis Cache"
participant DB as "PostGIS DB"
participant OP as "Overpass API"
U->>FE : "Enable GPS / View nearby services"
FE->>API : "GET /api/v1/emergency/nearby?lat&lon"
API->>R : "Check cache"
alt "Cache hit"
R-->>API : "Cached results"
else "Cache miss"
API->>DB : "ST_DWithin query (radius 5km)"
DB-->>API : "Nearby services"
API->>API : "Expand radius if < 3 results"
API->>OP : "Fallback via Overpass"
OP-->>API : "Additional POIs"
API->>R : "Cache results"
end
API-->>FE : "EmergencyResponse"
FE-->>U : "Map markers + service cards"
```

Practical example:
- Scenario: A car crashes on a remote highway with poor cell reception.
- Outcome: The app’s crash detection triggers an SOS with pre-filled GPS and emergency contacts, while the offline emergency map displays the nearest hospital and police station using cached GeoJSON and Turf.js.

- [frontend/app/page.tsx:77-228](file://frontend/app/page.tsx#L77-L228)

### AI Chatbot: Legal Grounding and Multilingual Assistance
The chatbot combines intent detection, RAG, and a 9-provider fallback chain to deliver accurate, contextual responses.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant U as "User"
participant FE as "Frontend"
participant CS as "Chatbot : 8010"
participant PR as "ProviderRouter"
participant C as "ChromaDB"
participant R as "Redis"
participant BE as "Backend : 8000"
U->>FE : "Message (voice/text)"
FE->>CS : "POST /api/v1/chat/"
CS->>CS : "SafetyChecker + IntentDetector"
CS->>CS : "ContextAssembler"
alt "Legal intent"
CS->>C : "Vector search (top-5 chunks)"
C-->>CS : "Relevant law text"
else "Emergency intent"
CS->>BE : "Call /api/v1/emergency/nearby"
BE-->>CS : "Nearby services"
end
CS->>R : "Load conversation history"
R-->>CS : "Previous messages"
CS->>PR : "Generate with provider chain"
PR-->>CS : "Response"
CS->>R : "Persist updated history"
CS-->>FE : "Formatted response"
FE-->>U : "Display answer + citations"
```

Practical example:
- Scenario: A driver receives a challan and is unsure about the fine amount and legal section.
- Outcome: The chatbot calculates the exact fine using DuckDB SQL and cites the relevant MVA section, enabling informed legal action.

### Challan Calculator: Deterministic Legal Compliance
Deterministic calculations grounded in the Motor Vehicles Act ensure clarity and fairness.

```mermaid

A["User submits violation_code, vehicle_class, state_code, repeat flag"] --> B["Backend validates payload"]
B --> C["DuckDB SQL join: national base fines + state overrides"]
C --> D{"Repeat offender?"}
D --> |Yes| E["Apply repeat_fine_inr"]
D --> |No| F["Use base_fine_inr"]
E --> G["Return ChallanResponse with citation"]
F --> G
```

Practical example:
- Scenario: A Tamil Nadu resident is charged under MVA_185 for drunk driving in a commercial vehicle.
- Outcome: The calculator returns the exact fine amount, the legal section cited, and state-specific adjustments.

### Road Reporter: Transparent Infrastructure Accountability
The Road Reporter module enables citizens to report road issues with automatic authority routing and transparency into maintenance records.

```mermaid

B --> C["Overpass API identifies highway tag at GPS"]
C --> D["Authority routing matrix selects responsible agency"]
D --> E["Store in DB + return RoadReportResponse"]
E --> F["Optional: Offline queue + Background Sync"]
F --> G["Community issues map layer"]
```

Practical example:
- Scenario: A pothole on a state highway causes repeated damage to vehicles.
- Outcome: The report is routed to the appropriate PWD office with transparency into budget and maintenance history, and nearby users receive warnings.

### Conceptual Overview
SafeVixAI’s conceptual design emphasizes a “life-safety command terminal” with two operational modes: Tactical Emergency (seconds count) and Operational Normal (research, compliance, reporting). The UI’s dark tactical palette, terminal aesthetics, and high-contrast typography reinforce urgency and clarity.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
A["User enters SafeVixAI"] --> B{"Task type?"}
B --> |Emergency| C["Tactical Emergency Mode"]
B --> |Legal/Challan| D["Operational Normal Mode"]
B --> |Report/Map| E["Operational Normal Mode"]
C --> F["SOS + Crash Detection + First Aid"]
D --> G["Challan Calculator + Legal Assistant"]
E --> H["Road Reporter + Authority Routing"]
```

## Dependency Analysis
SafeVixAI’s backend, chatbot, and frontend services depend on shared infrastructure and external datasets. The backend relies on PostGIS for spatial queries, Redis for caching, and Overpass/Nominatim for POI enrichment. The chatbot leverages ChromaDB for RAG and a 9-provider LLM fallback chain. The frontend consumes these services via HTTPS and operates offline through browser-based AI and cached assets.

## Performance Considerations
- Backend performance: PostGIS spatial queries (< 50 ms) with GIST indexing and Redis caching minimize latency for emergency services discovery.
- Offline performance: Five-layer offline stack ensures first-load functionality and minimal bandwidth usage.
- Chatbot performance: ProviderRouter auto-selects optimal LLMs; Sarvam AI handles Indian languages; fallback chain maintains reliability.
- Frontend performance: PWA with Service Worker caching, dynamic map loading, and offline AI reduces cold start and improves responsiveness.

[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]

## Troubleshooting Guide
- Backend health: Verify the health endpoint to confirm database and cache availability.
- API testing: Use curl to test emergency and challan endpoints locally or in production.
- Environment variables: Ensure all keys are configured in .env files and reflected in deployment dashboards.
- Offline verification: Build and start the frontend in production mode, then simulate offline mode to confirm cached features.

## Conclusion
SafeVixAI advances road safety in India by combining tactical UX, AI-driven legal assistance, and transparent infrastructure reporting—without any infrastructure cost. Its modular architecture, offline-first design, and open-source philosophy enable rapid deployment, community-driven improvements, and scalable impact across diverse geographies and languages.
