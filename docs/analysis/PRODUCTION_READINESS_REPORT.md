## 3. Production Readiness Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Fix Cost | Priority |
|-----|--------|----------|----------|
| .env credentials in git | Full compromise | 2h (rotate + filter) | P0 |
| No RBAC enforcement | Auth bypass | 4h (decorator) | P1 |
| No Host header validation | Injection risk | 1h (middleware) | P1 |
| No data retention | Privacy + DB growth | 1h (cron job) | P1 |
| No uptime monitoring | Blind ops | 1h (UptimeRobot) | P2 |
| Frontend 30% coverage | Quality blind spot | 20h (add tests) | P2 |
| Backend 59% coverage | Quality blind spot | 15h (DB tests) | P2 |
| No auto DB rollback | Migration risk | 2h (CI step) | P3 |

## 4. Recommendation

**For Hackathon (May 2026):** ✅ GO  
- Accept credential-in-git risk (private repo + rotate after event)
- All 25 features are demonstrable
- Core safety features (SOS, crash detection, offline queue) fully functional
- Chatbot works with any of 9 providers

**For Real Production:** ❌ NO-GO until:
1. All .env credentials rotated and git-cleaned
2. RBAC enforced on all admin/operator endpoints
3. Host header validation added
4. Data retention cron enabled
5. Minimum $14/mo for Render Starter (backend + chatbot)
6. UptimeRobot configured
