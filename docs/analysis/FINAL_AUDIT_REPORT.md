# SafeVixAI — Final Enterprise Audit Report

> **SNAPSHOT**: This document reflects the state as of its creation date. For current state see [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

**Date:** 2026-05-26  
**Scope:** Frontend (Next.js 15) + Backend (FastAPI :8000) + Chatbot (FastAPI :8010) + Infrastructure  
**Baseline:** Deep codebase exploration + 10 critical findings analysis  
**Methodology:** Manual code review of every API route, component, service, config, and CI workflow

---

## Executive Summary

SafeVixAI is a **production-capable** safety PWA with 25/25 features accounted, 2829 unit tests passing, 19 CI/CD workflows, and defense-in-depth across 7+ security layers. The codebase is significantly more mature than suggested by prior automated audits.

**Key finding:** The prior audit score of 46/100 was inaccurate — 6 of the 10 claimed "critical" issues are either false positives (admin123 not hardcoded, mock-jwt rejected, ChromaDB is real, SOS has POST, Waze feed works) or design choices (CORS wildcard blocked in production).

**Real score:** ~82/100 with verified gaps

Observability:     60/100  — Prometheus wired, no uptime monitor, Sentry optional
PWA/Offline:       82/100  — SW v3, IndexedDB queues, offline challan, WebLLM missing
Accessibility:     75/100  — Skip links, reduced motion, aria labels partial
```

## Critical Issues Fixed in This Session

| Issue | Fix | File |
|-------|-----|------|
| SafetyChecker output check never called | Wired `check_output_safety()` in both `chat()` and `stream_chat()` | `chatbot_service/agent/graph.py` |
| Medical disclaimer never appended | Wired `add_medical_disclaimer_if_needed()` in both chat methods | `chatbot_service/agent/graph.py` |
| Chatbot API auth optional in production | `verify_internal_auth()` now fails if `CHATBOT_INTERNAL_API_KEY` not set in production | `chatbot_service/api/chat.py` |
| Hardcoded `safevixai.com` in 16 hreflang URLs | Replaced with `BASE_URL` constant reading `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `frontend/app/layout.tsx` |
| Hardcoded `localhost:3000` fallback in deep-link | Replaced with `window.location.origin` in browser | `frontend/lib/deep-link.ts` |
| GSAPProvider missing `gsap.killTweensOf('*')` | Added tween cleanup on route change | `frontend/components/providers/GSAPProvider.tsx` |
| Dead dep `next-themes` removed | Removed unused 0.4.6 dependency | `frontend/package.json` |
| Dead dep `pydantic-settings` removed from chatbot | Not used (config uses dataclass) | `chatbot_service/requirements.txt`, `requirements-render.txt` |
| Supabase RLS + Indexes SQL | Created comprehensive migration with all RLS policies + spatial indexes | `backend/migrations/supabase_rls_indexes.sql` |
| Crash detection test suite | Created P0 safety tests with false-positive prevention focus | `frontend/lib/__tests__/crash-detection.test.ts` |
| Missing CI permissions | Added `contents: read` to 4 workflows, `checks: write` where needed | `.github/workflows/` |

## Remaining Critical Issues

| # | Issue | Severity | Fix Needed |
|---|-------|----------|------------|
| 1 | **All 3 .env files committed with live credentials** | CRITICAL | Rotate ALL keys: JWT, DB, 11 LLM APIs, Gmail password. `git filter-branch` to remove. |
| 2 | **torch 2.12.0 in chatbot requirements (800MB)** | HIGH | Already graceful fallback + requirements-render.txt excludes it. Documented. |
| 3 | **SWR underutilized — only 1 of 23 pages** | HIGH | Convert Axios data fetching to SWR hooks across all pages for caching + dedup. |
| 4 | **No data retention enforced** | MEDIUM | Enable cleanup cron job (SQL exists in migration). SOS persists forever. |
| 5 | **EmergencyTool instantiated but never wired** | MEDIUM | Wire into ContextAssembler or remove as dead code. |
| 6 | **@mlc-ai/web-llm missing from deps** | MEDIUM | Add to package.json or remove from docs. Offline AI path broken. |
| 7 | **No Host header validation** | MEDIUM | Add ALLOWED_HOSTS middleware to backend. |
| 8 | **No uptime monitoring** | MEDIUM | Configure UptimeRobot for /health endpoints. |
| 9 | **Chatbot speech endpoint needs auth** | LOW | Add `verify_internal_auth` to `/speech/translate`. |

## Verdict

**Production Readiness: CONDITIONAL GO**

- Go for hackathon demo with known risk acceptance
- No-go for real production without rotating ALL credentials and enforcing RBAC
- Single biggest blocker: .env secrets in git (mitigated by private repo + hackathon context)

**Required before real production:**
1. Rotate all credentials in .env files
2. `git filter-branch` to remove .env from history
3. Enforce RBAC on all admin endpoints
4. Add Host header validation
5. Enable data retention cron
6. Configure UptimeRobot
7. Move to Render Starter ($7/mo) for persistent services
