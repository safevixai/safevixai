# Security Requirements

> Documented security requirements for SafeVixAI — what users can and cannot expect from this software.

## What Users Can Expect

### Authentication & Identity
- **Authenticated users:** JWT-based auth with 24h access tokens and 30d refresh tokens.
- **Guest users:** Anonymous UUID-based guest identity — no sign-up required for core features.
- **Passwords:** Stored as iterated hashes with per-user salt (Argon2id via passlib).
- **2FA:** Core contributors and maintainers MUST use GitHub 2FA for repository access.

### Data Protection
- **In transit:** All network communication uses TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS, WSS). Service-to-service uses internal API keys.
- **At rest:** Redis chat history has 24h TTL. PostgreSQL database is encrypted at rest (cloud provider managed).
- **Personal data:**
  - Blood group, emergency contacts: stored only in IndexedDB on the user's device — never transmitted to the server.
  - GPS location: processed server-side for emergency services, cached only, not persisted.
  - Chat history: stored in Redis with 24-hour automatic expiry.
  - Session data: JWT claims contain only user UUID and role — no PII in tokens.

### API Security
- **Rate limiting:** Public endpoints throttle at 100 req/min (general), 5/min (auth), 3/min (SOS), 60/min (challan), 30/min (chat and geocode).
- **Input validation:** All API inputs validated via Pydantic schemas — type coercion, bounds checking, file type/size limits.
- **CORS:** Restricted to known origins in production. No wildcard.
- **CSRF:** Protection on all state-changing requests.
- **Host validation:** ALLOWED_HOSTS middleware rejects mismatched Host headers.

### LLM Safety
- **Prompt injection defense:** SafetyChecker evaluates all user messages against 60+ injection patterns (jailbreaks, NFKC normalization bypass, zero-width characters, l33t speak, RAG prompt injection).
- **Injury disclosure:** Any response about injuries MUST begin with "Call 112 immediately."
- **Timeout:** All LLM provider calls enforce `asyncio.wait_for()` with configurable timeout.
- **RAG sanitization:** Retrieved context is sanitized before injection into LLM prompts.

### Vulnerability Management
- **Reporting:** Private vulnerability reporting via email and GitHub Security Advisories.
- **SLA:** Acknowledgment within 48 hours. Critical fixes within 14 days.
- **Disclosure:** Coordinated disclosure — reporters agree to wait for fix release.

## What Users Cannot Expect

- **Perfect security:** No software is 100% secure. We follow industry best practices and respond to reported vulnerabilities promptly.
- **End-to-end encryption:** Chat messages are encrypted in transit (TLS) but decrypted server-side for LLM processing.
- **Formal verification:** The codebase has not undergone formal mathematical verification.
- **Air-gap security:** The service requires network connectivity for most features (offline mode is limited).
- **Regulatory compliance:** While we follow security best practices, we have not undergone formal certification (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.).

## Security Boundaries

| Boundary | Trust Level | Security Controls |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| User ↔ Frontend | Untrusted | TLS, CSP, XSS protection, Content Security Policy |
| Frontend ↔ Backend | Low | JWT auth, CORS, rate limiting, input validation |
| Backend ↔ Chatbot | Medium | Internal API key, private network |
| Backend ↔ Database | Medium | Network isolation, encrypted connections |
| Chatbot ↔ LLM Provider External APIs | Low | API keys, network egress controls, timeouts |
| All ↔ Public Internet | Untrusted | WAF, rate limiting, DDoS protection, CSP |

## Cryptographic Requirements

| Requirement | Implementation | Standard |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Password hashing | Argon2id via passlib | NIST SP 800-63B |
| JWT signing | HS256 | RFC 7519 |
| TLS | 1.2+ | NIST SP 800-52 |
| CSPRNG | secrets module (Python) / crypto.getRandomValues (JS) | FIPS 140-2 |
| Key lengths | 256-bit (JWT), 128-bit+ (TLS) | NIST SP 800-57 (2030+) |

## Third-Party Security

SafeVixAI depends on the security of:
- **GitHub** — for repository hosting, CI/CD, container registry, and security advisories.
- **Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend, Chatbot), Supabase (PostgreSQL), Upstash (Redis)** — cloud infrastructure providers with their own security programs.
- **LLM API providers (Groq, Cerebras, Gemini, etc.)** — user messages are sent to these providers for AI responses.
- **npm/PyPI ecosystems** — dependencies are pinned and scanned for known vulnerabilities.
